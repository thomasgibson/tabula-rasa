# Code verification

This directory contains two experiments for a model elliptic equation. The purpose here is to provide code verification for the framework presented in the paper:
> Thomas H. Gibson, Lawrence Mitchell, David A. Ham, and Colin J. Cotter.
> "Slate: extending Firedrake's domain-specific abstraction to hybridized solvers for geoscience and beyond".

The directory `HMM` contains convergence tests for hybridizable mixed methods for Raviart-Thomas (on triangles and quadrilaterals) and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini discretizations. All data is written to the `HMM/results` directory, and plotting scripts are provided which generates a convergence plot. To run the full set of convergence tests, simply activate the Firedrake virtual environment:
```
source firedrake/bin/activate
```
and execute:
```
python3 run_hybrid_mixed_mtd_convergence.py
```

A convergence plot for the Raviart-Thomas discretizations can be generated by running:
```
python3 plot_hrt_conv.py
```

A second directory `LDGH` contains an HDG discretization of the same model elliptic equation. Results can be generated, as well as a figure, via:
```
python3 run_LDGH_convergence.py
python3 plot_ldgh_conv.py
```

A summary of the convergence tests is provided in the document `code_verification.pdf`.
